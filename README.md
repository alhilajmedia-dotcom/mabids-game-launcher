An extremely light-weight game launcher made in Java that can run almost any game.

# Minimum Specs
OS: Windows XP
Java Version: 8

# How to Use it
* Go to File -> New on the menu bar, or right-click on the left-most "panel" and click New.
* Set the name to whatever you want.
* Set the location field to the root directory of the game you want to add to the launcher.
* Set the launch commands field to whatever launch commands you need to execute in order to run the game. Note they are Command Prompt (or Bash if you're on Linux/MacOS) commands.
* All of these fields will be saved in a .gc file inside a folder that will be created right next to the .jar file. You can also change them by right-clicking on a game on the left-most panel and clicking on "Edit", going to the menu bar and clicking Edit -> Edit, or you can just click on one of them and you will find a "Edit" button.
* Click on a game on the left-most "panel" or right-click on it and you will find the launch and delete button. 

That's it, I guess. Note that almost every single "action" metioned here has a certain key assigned to it that you can check in the menu bar.
