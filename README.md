An extremely light-weight game launcher made in Java that can run almost any game.

# How to Use it
*Go to File -> New on the menu bar.
*Set the name to whatever you want.
*Set the location field to the root directory of the game you want to add to the launcher.
*Set the launch commands field to whatever launch commands you need to execute in order to run the game. Note they are Command Prompt (or Bash if you're on Linux/MacOS) commands.
*All of these fields will be saved in a .gc file inside a folder that will be created right next to the .jar file. You can also change them by right-clicking on a game on the left-most "panel" and clicking on "Settings", or you can just click on one of them and you will find a "Settings" button.
*Click on a game on the left-most "panel" or right-click on it and you will find the launch and delete button. Note if you have deleted something or changed the settings of a game, you might need to restart MGL in order to see the changes.

That's it, I guess. All the bugs listed will be fixed in MGL 1.0.1a. This project was a bit rushed, so I guess these are the consequences...
